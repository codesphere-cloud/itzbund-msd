# OZG Security Challenge - Keycloak Theme

In this repository you will find the Keycloak theme, which was developed as part of the OZG Security Challenge. Keycloak is an open source Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. As part of the OZG Security Challenge, a special Keycloak theme was developed to create a uniform and user-friendly interface for the authentication and authorisation of users.

### Background

With public administration becoming more digital, the importance of information security is growing. Citizens and companies expect the state to protect their personal information with high levels of IT security. The [Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community (BMI)](https://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/startseite/startseite-node.html) would therefore like to further promote the increase in IT security during the implementation of the OZG and has launched the ‘OZG Security Challenge 2023’ in cooperation with the [Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html).
